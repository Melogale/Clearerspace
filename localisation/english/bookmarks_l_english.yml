 BAY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the end of the First World War and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, Bavaria was left in a shaken state. Soon after their newfound and unwelcome independence, the nation fell to revolutionaries during the October Revolution. With the rest of Europe still recovering from the tragedy of the war, intervention was ruled out in favor of an international embargo. The Bavarian Worker's Republic now stands alone and cut off from the world around them; a solution to the embargo must come soon or else the Communist Party of Bavaria may too become victims of a revolution."
