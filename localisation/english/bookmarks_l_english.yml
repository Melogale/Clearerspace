 BAY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the end of the First World War and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, Bavaria was left in a shaken state. Soon after their newfound and unwelcome independence, the nation fell to revolutionaries during the October Revolution. With the rest of Europe still recovering from the tragedy of the war, intervention was ruled out in favor of an international embargo. The Bavarian Worker's Republic now stands alone and cut off from the world around them; a solution to the embargo must come soon or else the Communist Party of Bavaria may too become victims of a revolution."
 PLC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the Commonwealth's victory in the First World War, the National Democracy party cemented itself as the ideal rulers in both wartime and civilian politic. However, this status quo may well be overturned with the upcoming Sejm. The Polonisation Act is the hot topic of the Commonwealth's politics and it shall decide the fate of the union as a whole. Should it pass, ethnic and religious minorities will find themselves ostracised in a nation that once cherished them. A Left Coalition has formed between the liberals, social democrats, and various minority parties as a last-ditch effort to stop this bill from passing, but will it be enough to stop the conservatives?"
